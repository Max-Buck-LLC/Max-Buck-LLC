            Hi, I'm Max. I am passionate about development and have had the
            opportunity to work with a wide range of companies, from large
            corporations to startups, across a variety of stacks. I am grateful
            for the relationships I have built throughout my career, and I rely
            on them to help me provide the best possible service to our clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a graduate of Ohio State University, where I earned my degree
            in Computer Science. Since then, I have worked at a number of
            companies, including Chase, Battelle Memorial Institute, SafeChain,
            Quill.org, AudioHeads, Aetna Integrated Services, CoverMyMeds, and
            Tandem. In addition, I have been the lead organizer for GiveBackHack
            Columbus for the past three years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether or not we end up working together, I would love the
            opportunity to chat more and learn more about your needs. Please
            don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like
            to discuss your software development goals further. I look forward
            to connecting with you!
